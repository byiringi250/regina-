Foundation Concepts of Databases  
1. How does the database approach differ from traditional file systems?  
   Provide a detailed comparison highlighting aspects like data redundancy, data integrity, and ease of access. Use a practical example, such as comparing a small business using individual Excel files versus a centralized database to track sales and inventory.  

2. What are the key components of a database system, and how do they contribute to efficient data management?  
   Discuss the roles of components like the DBMS, hardware, software, users, and the database itself. Explain how these components work together to organize, retrieve, and manage data effectively.  
Database Management  
3. What is the role of a Database Management System (DBMS) in handling large datasets within an organization?  
   Explain how a DBMS centralizes data management, ensures data consistency, and enables efficient querying and reporting. Provide examples like managing customer data for a retail chain.  

4. Imagine a university uses a DBMS to manage student records. What challenges might arise, and how can the DBMS address these issues?  
   Explain potential challenges such as data security, scalability, and maintaining data integrity. Discuss features of a DBMS like user access controls, backups, and indexing to mitigate these challenges.  
Database Structures and Types  
5. Compare and contrast hierarchical and relational database structures. Provide real-world examples.  
   Describe the differences in how data is organized, stored, and accessed in hierarchical (tree-like structure) and relational (tables with relationships) databases. Examples might include a file system for hierarchical databases versus an e-commerce website for relational databases.  

6. What are the advantages of using a NoSQL database for a large-scale e-commerce application?  
   Discuss benefits such as scalability, flexibility in data types, and fast query performance. Provide an example, such as Amazon or eBay, to illustrate the use of NoSQL databases.  
Database Design  
7. Design a basic database schema for a library management system, identifying primary and foreign keys.  
   Include entities like Books, Members, and Loans. Describe the relationships, such as a Loan table connecting Books and Members through foreign keys.  

8. Why is normalization important in database design, and what are the consequences of skipping it?  
   Explain normalizationâ€™s role in reducing redundancy and improving data integrity. Use examples to show how denormalized data can lead to inconsistencies.  
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
9. Draw an ERD for an online retail store with entities like Customers, Orders, and Products.  
   Include attributes like customer names, product details, and order dates. Highlight relationships, such as a customer placing multiple orders.  

10. How do ERDs help in visualizing the logical structure of a database before implementation?  
    Explain how ERDs simplify database design by showing entities, attributes, and relationships, helping to prevent design errors.
